[2.0.0]
### New features
- Clicking on Omnisearch's search result makes jump to the first match.
- Support custom icons from [Iconic][] plugin for the file icons.
- Add buttons above displayed files to switch between bookmarks and recents.
- (Desktop only) Support dragging displayed files to be dropped as link/new tab.
- (Web search) Add "Search for" and "Go to" suggestion whenever typing in search bar.

### Adjustments
- Refreshed UI.
- Suggestion is no longer pushing down the displayed files.
- Use Webviewer instead of Surfing (Surfing will be brought back again in the future).
- Icon customizing on bookmarks now relies on [Iconic][].

### Optimization
Home tab will only be refreshed after closing Settings in the case of settings change.

### Bug fixes
- Default new tab view appears before changing to the Home tab view.
- (Mobile) Suggestion wasn't shown when selecting custom font.

### Development
Porting Svelte to the [version 5.x][Svelte5].
